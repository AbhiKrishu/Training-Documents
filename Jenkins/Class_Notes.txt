	DevOps :::
	
		Is a softare Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in fully automated fashion.
		
	Teams involved in process :::
	
		DevOps Team :::				
			Infra-Structure Team 			
			Application Development Team 
			Testing Team 
			Release Management Team 
			Production Support Team 
			Production Monitoring Team 
			Security Team 
		
		Role of DevOps Team ==> Always try to find the scope for automation.
	
		Infra-Structure Team 	:::
			Provisioning the servers 			IAC(Infra-Structure As Code) Tools like Terraform - (Server Provisioning Tool)		
			Configuration of the servers		Ansible - (Configuration Management Tools)
	
	DevOps Stages ::::
		
		Continuous Development ::  Development Team: Developers :
					What is the role of Developer?
					
				Create the Application Source Code.
				Build 	==> Process of compile the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll)
				Unit Testing 
				Promote the changes to Test Environment 
				Notify the Testing team to pick the changes for testing
				
			Using DevOps Approch ::
			
				Create the Application Source Code, maintain the source code in a source code repository (github)
						IDEs - Eclipse based IDEs/Visual Studio Code/Pycharm/Visual Studio
			
			DevOps Automate the below process :
				Build 	==> Process of compile the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll)
				Unit Testing 
				Promote the changes to Test Environment 
				Notify the Testing team to pick the changes for testing
				
			Tools :: GIT, Jenkins, Build Tools(Maven/Gradle)
				
		
	    Continuous Integration ::
				It is the capability of DEV Team to continuously integrate the changes for further Testing.
									Promote the changes to Test Environment

				Tools :: GIT, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible
			
		Continuous Testing 
				It helps to perform automate testing, this can integrated in DevOps work flow.
				
				Tools :: GIT, Jenkins, JUNIT,TESTNG,SELENIUM
				
			
	    Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment :::
		
				Both Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment are used for Production Release.
				
				Continuous Delivery - (Required Manual Intervension/Approval for Production Release)
				Continuous Deployment - (Doesn't Required Manual Approval for Production Release. It is completely automated)
				
				
				Tools :: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible
				
		Continuous Monitoring :::
		
				
				Retails - E_Commerce / Online Tkt Reservation ::

		DevOps Implementations ::::
		
	DevOps :::
	
		Is a softare Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in fully automated fashion.		
		
		
	Process ::::
	
		Application :
		
				Monolith Application Architecture  ::
					Tightly coupled Application
					With all the dependencies coupled together.
						Billing System
							Front-End 
							Application Logic 
								USER_Management 	==> developer - Make some changes in this module, code, test, promote to prod.	
								Product_Management 
								Prize_Management 
								Billing_Management 
								Reports
						User-Registration System
						
						Banking/Insurance/Retails/Tele-Comm/		==> Legacy Applications 
				
				Micro-Service Based Application Architecture ::
					Loosely Application ::

					Billing System
						Front-End 
						Application Logic 
							USER_Management 	(function)==> developer - Make some changes in this module, code, test, promote to prod.	
							Product_Management 
							Prize_Management 
							Billing_Management 
							Reports
					User-Registration System			

					Functions/Modules ==> micro-service
					
					E_Commerce - Amazon 
					Facebook
					Netflix 
					google				
				
			E_Commerce - Amazon = www.amazon.com :::

			Functions/Modules ==>	Micro-Service
					
					3-Tier Application -> Front-End/Application_logic/Back_end(Database)
					
					
				Sign_Up 			==> Service1 => Developer1 - Make code Changes ==> Build,Unit_Test,promote the code for further Testing ==> Release to Prod.
				Sign_In 
				Search for products 
				Add to Cart 
				Place the Order 
				Payment 
				Confirm Order 
				Track
					
		
			Continuous Delivery :::
					- It needs manual approval for Prod Release 
					
				Banking_Application ::
					Online - banking / credit card 
					
						Production Release Window ==> 4hrs. to 6hrs. (Non-Business Hours)
							Complete validation and review/ seek approvals from all stake holders for the prod release
								--> If any issue occurs ?
								
										- Try to fix the issue within the Release Window .
										
										- Revert the changes.
										
			Continuous Deployment 			==> This is considered as the Matured level of DevOps.
			
					- Completely automated Prod Release 
					
					E_Commerce - Amazon 
					Facebook
					Netflix 
					google

		
			
			Implementations ::
			
				1. Detailed Assessment of existing Application
		


			DevOps LifeCycle ::::
			
				Coding ==> Build ==> Create Artifacts ==> Promoted to Test Environment ==> Automated Testing ==> Released to Production Environment ==> Monitoring
				
				
			Environment ::::
			
				Non-Prod Environment										===>									Production Environment
				
					Dev 
					Build 
					Testing 
						QA - Quality Assurance 
						UAT - User Acceptance Testing 						===>										Prod Environment

						-------
						-----
						------
						-----
						--
						
					
					1. Save the file(latest Change) ==> Unit Test	

					2. Save the file(latest Change) ==> Unit Test	==> Not working as expected		

							How to identify the latest change ???
							
					Version Control System :::
					
						- Is used to version control the file changes 
						- Is used to track the changes

						6. index.jsp_v1.5					==> 
						
					Types of Version Control System ::::
					
						1. Local VCS 
						2. Centralized VCS 
						3. Distributed VCS
						
						
					GIT : Is one of the open-Source Distributed VCS 
					
						- It is used to version Control the changes 
						- It is used to track the changes 
						- It is used to perform Parallel Development
						
						
						
					Developers' Workload ::::
					
						- Enhancement-project
						- Bug-fixing 
						
						- New Project
						
						
						
					
					Git Workflow:: ***

					index.jsp						index.jsp							index.jsp_v1.0							index.jsp_v1.0
									--------->						-----------> 						---------->	
									git add 						git commit							git push
					
					
					fork				==> Used to copy a Remote Repository to another remote repository
					
					git clone 			==> Used to copy/clone the entire repository from Remote Repository to Local Machine
					
					git add 			==> Used to add the changes from Working Dir. to Staging Area
					
					git commit 			==> Used to Commit the changes from staging area to Local Repository 
					
					git push 			==> Used to push the changes from Local Repository to Remote Repository 					

					
					git fetch/pull :: 	==> Both git fetch & git pull are used to handle the incremental Changes.
					
						git fetch		==> It is just to check for any incremental changes happened in remote repo.
											If there is any changes available in remote repository it will updated only in the local repository. It will never update the changes in working Directory.
											
											later we can use merge/checkout command to bring the changes to from local repository to working dir.
											
						git pull		==> It will check for any incremental changes happened in remote repo.
											If there is any changes available in remote repository it will updated the local repository as well as the working Directory.
												
							git pull 	==> git fetch + git Merge

			Create Branch :::
			
				git branch 					== List of Branches in repo
				
				git branch <branch_name>
				
				git switch -c <branch_name>
				
				git checkout -b <branch_name>
				
				
			repo :
			
				master - cm1,cm2,cm3
				
					feature1 - cm1,cm2,cm3,f1cm1	==> once changes are ready,
					
					git switch master 				==> switch to target branch 
					
					git merge feature1 				==> merge command shd be executed only from target branch
					
					
					
				Why the Merge Conflict Occurs ?
				
					When more than one feature try to update same file and record in the target branch will get merge conflict.
				
				How to resolve Merge Conflict ?
				
					- Identify the file(s) that is causing the merge conflict
					- Open that file and review the changes 
					- Decide which changes has to retained / removed.
					- Update the content of the file accordingly, also remove all the unwanted header and footer created during conflict
					- perform git add and commit on the target branch.
					
					
				--> Prevent the Merge - Conflict!!!
				
					Review the changes before merge.
					
					
			git rebase ::: => 	used to prevent merge conflict in target branch and keep you current branch in sync with target branch.
								Maintains Linear commits
			
								It is always recommended to use rebase before any merge.

		Handling Remote Repository :::
		
			using git hub!
		
			
					Developers' Workload ::::
					
						- Enhancement-project
						- Bug-fixing 
						
						- New Project
						
						
						
					
					Git Workflow:: ***
					
					
					Local Machine																					Remote Server
					
					Working Directory 		--> Staging/Index Area		--> 		Local Repository 		-->			Remote Repository
					index.jsp						index.jsp							index.jsp_v1.0							index.jsp_v1.0
									--------->						-----------> 						---------->	
									git add 						git commit							git push
					
					
					fork				==> Used to copy a Remote Repository to another remote repository
					
					git clone 			==> Used to copy/clone the entire repository from Remote Repository to Local Machine
					
					git add 			==> Used to add the changes from Working Dir. to Staging Area
					
					git commit 			==> Used to Commit the changes from staging area to Local Repository 
					
					git push 			==> Used to push the changes from Local Repository to Remote Repository 					

					
					git fetch/pull :: 	==> Both git fetch & git pull are used to handle the incremental Changes.
					
						git fetch		==> It is just to check for any incremental changes happened in remote repo.
											If there is any changes available in remote repository it will updated only in the local repository. It will never update the changes in working Directory.
											
											later we can use merge/checkout command to bring the changes to from local repository to working dir.
											
						git pull		==> It will check for any incremental changes happened in remote repo.
											If there is any changes available in remote repository it will updated the local repository as well as the working Directory.
												
							git pull 	==> git fetch + git Merge
